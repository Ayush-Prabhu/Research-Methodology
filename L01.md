  - Textbooks represent accumulated knowledge; research involves exploring unknown territories.
  - Research is unpredictable and often lacks a clear structure.
- **Learning and Discovery**:
  - Research is about searching for knowledge and discovering new insights.
  - The process can be hazy at the beginning, driven by passion and persistence.

### 4. Incremental vs. Path-Breaking Research
- **Research Approach**:
  - Most research starts with incremental knowledge addition, leading to potential breakthroughs.
  - Researchers must ask relevant questions and seek meaningful answers.

### 5. Selecting a Research Area and Advisor
- **Importance of Interest**:
  - Choose a research area that genuinely interests you to ensure motivation and engagement.
- **Finding the Right Advisor**:
  - The advisor's compatibility with the studentâ€™s style and interests is crucial.
  - Consider the advisor's experience, energy, and ability to guide through challenges.

### 6. Practical Considerations
- **Research Area Selection**:
